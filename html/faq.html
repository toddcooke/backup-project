	<dt><h2>Regular Backup</dt></h2>
		<dd>-- To set up a basic backup, start here. You will be prompted to enter a date you want your data backed up. On that date, every 60 seconds the program will check to see if the backup has already been performed. The values for a date can either be entered manually in, or you can click the arrow located on the right of the field to drop down a calendar and pick your backup date.

		-- You will also be asked to enter how many days you would like between your backups. We understand the need to maximize the use of RAM and disk space on your computer, so we have provided the option to backup only as often as you would like. Enter a numeric value that will represent the number of days between backups. 
		<br><br>
		-- Finally, you will be asked to enter the path to the file or directory you would like backed up.
		<br><br>
		The following gives examples on what a file path looks like in their respective Operating Systems. The examples will show how to backup a user's Pictures directory.

				<li><b>Windows:</b> C:\Users\user1\Pictures</li>
				<li><b>Mac OSX:</b> /Users/user1/Pictures</li>

	<dt><h2>Manage Backups</dt></h2>
		<dd>-- After configuring your backup dates, you can view all current backups from the "View Backups" link. Here you will find a table that has all relevant information on your backups. 
		<br><br>
		   Here's a quick explanation on what the values on the table mean:
			<ul style = "list-style-type:none">
				<li><b>Bup_ID:</b> This is a value that identifies your backups, starting at 1.</li>
				<li><b>Path:</b> The path to the directory you want backed up.</li>
				<li><b>Offset:</b> The value that is how many days between backups.</li>
				<li><b>Date of first backup:</b> The date the very first backup was performed.</li>
				<li><b>Date of performed backup:</b> The date the most recent backup was performed.</li>
			</ul>

	<dt><h2>Restore Backup</dt></h2>
		<dd>-- If disaster has struck and you need to recover your backup, follow the "Manage Backups" link. Here you will find a table of all backups that you have scheduled, with a blue "Restore" button found on the right side. Locate the backup that you would like to restore, click "Restore", and... that's it!</dd>
